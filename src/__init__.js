/**
 * Welcome to the source code of Jaspy!
 * ====================================
 * Warning: Python interpreter under construction!
 *
 * So you like to learn how Jaspy works under the hood? You have made the first important
 * step â€” you are reading the source code of Jaspy. In case you only want to use Jaspy you
 * probably should instead read the user documentation [1]_.
 *
 * The in-source documentation is more or less a loose bunch of thoughts, ideas, and other
 * stuff than well-structured and well-conceived. However I will try to explain the rough
 * ideas and concepts behind the implementation.
 *
 * .. [1] https://jaspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
 *
 *
 * Motivation
 * ----------
 * Why should one come up with yet another Python-JavaScript-Thingamajig? Just to give you
 * a few examples why this might be a good idea:
 *
 * - First of all programming is fun, so why not?
 * - Learn how to build an interpreter and the corresponding runtime environment.
 * - Get a better and deep understanding of the Python programming language.
 * - Experiment with web technologies and see what is possible.
 * - Learn JavaScript although your really do not want to. ;)
 *
 * However I do not want to reinvent the wheel, therefore Jaspy is also an experiment on
 * how to implement various features others are not offering. This includes threading, a
 * built-in debugger, Greenlets, blocking IO, and other features.
